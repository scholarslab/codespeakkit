codespeakkit
============
This is work-in-progress by the [Scholars' Lab][slab] at [UVa Library][uva-lib], toward a "starter kit" for holding events and continuing conversations under the banner of [Speaking in Code][codespeak]. The original event was an [NEH][neh]-funded summit for digital humanities software developers held at the [University of Virginia][uva] in November of 2013.
