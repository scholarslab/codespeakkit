# Participants

Probably the most important aspect of conducting a Speaking in Code is the
participants. We put some thought into what kind of discussions and discourses
we wanted to provide a platform for, to encourage, and to amplify. Our
statement, "You are Welcome Here," embodies our thoughts on this.

## "You are Welcome Here"

This statement was important for several reasons. First, it expressed the kind
of discussion that we wanted to take place. It set the tone for all of the
participants, both minorities and cisgender white males.

But most importantly, it went beyond an assertion that this would be a safe
space. More, it was an invitation. We wanted to make clear that we were
actively looking for voices that are marginalized in other software development
settings. We wanted to listen and to hear what they have to say. 

This invitation is important enough that we'll reproduce it here:

> This is a small planning and problem-scoping meeting, meant to provide an
> opportunity for advanced software developers to address shared issues in DH
> and tacit knowledge—on their own terms. Because software development—even in
> the more intellectually diverse and welcoming digital humanities—is a
> predominantly white and male profession, we are particularly committed to
> amplifying the voices of developers who are women, people of color,
> queer/LGBT, or otherwise under-represented among programmers, and to creating
> a friendly and respectful environment for collaboration at this event.

# Speakers

The other important consideration is the speakers to invite. They are the
immediate provocation for the summit. Their presentations start the discussion,
which the participants take over. The topics begin, but don't dominate, and the
conversation can move outward from there.

# What is "productive"

Whether driven by the speakers or the participants, the discussion is meant to
be productive. But *productive* here isn't related to typical metrics of
production, lines of code, or items on a burn-down chart.

Instead, *production* is a sense of meaningful communication and community
building. There may be action items coming out of the summit, but the
fundamental product is the community being created through the discussions and
informal sessions.
