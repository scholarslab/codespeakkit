# Introduction

[Speaking in Code][codespeak] was an [NEH][neh]-funded symposium and summit. On
November 4â€“5, 2013, thirty-two software developers and practitioners active in
the digital humanities met at the [Scholars' Lab][slab] in the [University of
Virginia][uva] [Library][uva-lib]. They gathered with the intent of exploring
and making explicit the kinds of tacit knowledge that inform and underlie software
development, especially in the context of DH projects. The purpose was to
reflect on the context of our work, discuss the transmission of tacit knowledge and whether our practices and communication patterns contribute to an ongoing disconnect between developers and humanities scholars, and to interrogate DH code itself, *as practitioners*. We were particularly interested in welcoming and listening to developers who could speak from perspectives that have traditionally been marginalized in software development.

In the end, in part due to our success in bringing together an unusually diverse group of developers and participants' shared sense of the specialness of that opportunity, the focus of the meeting diverged from code critique and conversation about tacit knowledge transmission in the act of software development. Participants instead spent the most of the
two days identifying and discussing ways to dismantle social barriers, both explicit and implicit, spoken and tacit -- barriers to access to digital humanities communities and conversations, and internal barriers dividing the DH community. These might range from  knowledge acquisition required to perform technical work, to the way the field's structures of review and reward primarily address the needs of traditionally-employed scholars rather than all members of digital humanities teams. Participants also examined the working conditions, social and power structures, and (lack of) diversity found in technical environments in general and in DH work in particular.

Discussions at [Speaking in Code][codespeak] were challenging, thought-provoking, open, heartfelt, and compelling -- and we want to share. We put together this kit to amplify voices, to continue conversations, and to enable more DH and digital library software developers and members of our larger digital humanities community to join in.

This kit is your key to hosting conversations of your own.

But there are no step-by-step instructions. In fact, your Speaking in Code will -- and should! --
look different from the one held in November 2013. This is a loose set of
suggestions, priorities, and practices to encourage the type of discussion that
the Scholars' Lab attendees found transformative. Nevertheless it will be *your* Speaking in Code. It will grow out of your context and address the concerns of your participants.

The main concrete tool in this kit is a website template. It includes basic
styling, slots for necessary information, an application for interested
practitioners, and the *You are Welcome Here* statement. You can fork this git
repository, use the styles and overall design we created, and customize the template as you wish to jumpstart your own Speaking in Code summit.

However, you don't have to wait to join in the conversation. We are committed to continuing the discussion online:

* [#codespeak][twitter] (Twitter)
* [#speakingincode][irc] (IRC)
