# Introduction

## What is It?

[Speaking in Code][codespeak] was an [NEH][neh]-funded symposium and summit.
For November 4â€“5, 2013, thirty-two digital humanities software developers and
practitioners met at the [University of Virginia][uva] [Library][uva-lib]
[Scholars' Lab][slab].

They gathered around the issue of identifying, unpacking, exploring, and making
explicit the tacit knowledge that goes into creating digital humanities
projects. While there they listened to presentations, talked, plotted,
discussed, and picked apart the assumptions implicit in the code and technical
structures. They also interrogated the working conditions, social and power
structures, and (lack of) diversity often found in DH work.

The discussions were challenging, thought-provoking, and compelling. We want to
share that opportunity.

## What it can Accomplish?

This kit is your key to staging your own Speaking in Code summit.  There are no
step-by-step instructions. In fact, your Speaking in Code may look very
different from the one that was held at the Scholars' Lab in November 2013. It
is a loose set of suggestions, priorities, and practices to encourage the type
of discussion that we found so transformative. But it will be *your* Speaking
in Code. It will fit into your environment and address the concerns of your
participants.

## Ethos

The primary ethos of Speaking in Code is interrogating unspoken practices, by
the practitioners themselves.
