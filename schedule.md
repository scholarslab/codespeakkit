# Schedule

The November 2013 Speaking in Code summit was held over two days. The first
began the discussion with a more formal group of talks, and the second was
comprised of a number of un-conference-style break-out sessions.

## Day One

### Welcome

At the beginning of the first day, the welcome message sets the tone and lays
the ground rules. It establishes an atmosphere of openness, candor, and
respect.

The primary ground rule was that all discussions took place under the [Chatham
House Rule][chatham]: the information is open, but participants should not be
identified. This applied to all media, new media, social media, as well as
traditional media.

That decision was the outcome of discussion. A number of options were brought
up, but the group reached consensus on using the Chatham House Rule.

Being able to discuss this topic and reach a consensus helped to create an open
arena for the discussion. Participants could speak freely without fearing
repercussions from colleagues, employers, or others who may be unaware of the
context and full meaning of their remarks.

### Presentation and discussion on a variety of topics

Most of the time on the first day was spent in a series of talks. Although
ostensibly more formal, some of these talks involved group activities and
brainstorming. All of them included time for questions and discussion.

### Dinner

A working dinner closed out the first day. Each table carried on brainstorming
and discussion related to the activities and topics for the next day.

## Day Two

The second day was more "hands-on" in the broadest sense. There were a few
hacking sessions; however, most of the sessions centered around discussion.
These pushed hard on their respective topics and worked toward increasing
understanding, if not always achieving consensus or closure.
