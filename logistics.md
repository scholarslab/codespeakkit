We won't even attempt to cover talk about event planning here. Just remember
that you're dealing with a technically sophisticated audience, so if they don't
have good wifi, they'll scream like psychotic banshees. Lack of coffee will be
just as bad, albeit less energetic, more on the lines of lethargic golems.

Finally, and seriously, the break-out sessions were where people connected and
where the most important conversations happened. Make sure there will be enough
space for several groups of varying sizes.
