# Introduction

[Speaking in Code][codespeak] was an [NEH][neh]-funded symposium and summit.
For November 4â€“5, 2013, thirty-two digital humanities software developers and
practitioners met at the [University of Virginia][uva] [Library][uva-lib]
[Scholars' Lab][slab]. They gathered with the intent of exploring and making
explicit some of the tacit knowledge that informs and supports software
development, especially in the context of digital humanities projects.

In the end, the focus of the meeting diverged from there, and the participants
spent the two days identifying, unpacking, and exploring barriers, both
barriers to access digital humanities communities and barriers within those
communities. This might involve the knowledge required to perform the technical
work to the communication as well as the field's structures of promotion and
other things only addressing the needs of academics. They also interrogated the
working conditions, social and power structures, and (lack of) diversity often
found in technical environments in general and in DH work in particular.

We spent our time *as practitioners*, reflecting on and interrogating the
context of our work, as well as the work itself, paying special attention to
welcoming and listening to marginalized voices.

The discussions were challenging, thought-provoking, and compelling, and we
want to share. We put together this kit to encourage those voices further, to
continue those conversations, and to enable others to begin and join this and
related discussions.

This kit is your key.

But there are no step-by-step instructions. In fact, your Speaking in Code may
look very different from the one that was held in November 2013. It is a loose
set of suggestions, priorities, and practices to encourage the type of
discussion that we found so transformative. But it will be *your* Speaking in
Code. It will fit into your environment and address the concerns of your
participants.

The main tool in this kit is a website template. It includes basic styling,
places for the necessary information, an application for interested
practitioners, and the *You are Welcome Here* statement. You can fork this git
repository and use this template to begin the journey of hosting your own
Speaking in Code summit.

However, you don't have to do that much or wait that long to join in the
conversation. We're continuing the discussion on `#codespeak`:
