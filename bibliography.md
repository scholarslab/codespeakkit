# Bibliography

Here we share some readings that were important to us in putting together the inaugural Speaking in Code event. 

## Code as Craft

"Speaking in Code," both as an event and a minor movement in the DH community, draws inspiration from larger movements in the software development world that encourage professionalization and code quality. These often speak of software development as a craft, possessed of its own best practices and rationale—its own theoretical basis, underlying the code produced and recommendations made by expert developers. Their suggestions are meant to apply to any programming language, and to almost any project. In fact, the recommendations of some software development communities extend beyond the act of programming itself and include suggestions for the work environment, such as specifying labor conditions and outlining collaborative practices that constitute an ethic and philosophy. Although the connection is rarely made explicit, the Scholars' Lab traces these impulses to the deeply humanistic work of William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. Readings in this section also include historicizing of software and platform development.

## Academic and Aesthetic Considerations of Code

The media studies and digital humanities communities have discussed programming and software development for many years, but less often from the point of view of the everyday, practicing developer, and more often from the standpoint of the cultural critic or appreciator of code aesthetics. Critical Code Studies looks at code as an artistic object. This includes such practices as code poetry and interpreting code as literary texts. Software Studies is a broader area of study, which tends to pay less attention to the code itself and more to its end-product in software, and the place of that software in modern culture. Speaking in Code draws upon both of these areas of study, but its focus is more practical and hands-on. How do we create a software development culture in digital humanities that produces code which has beauty as well as considered, self-aware cultural impact—but which is also solidly constructed, flexible, and easy to maintain? How can we best mentor new developers and welcome a more diverse cohort of colleagues into digital humanities software development?

## Digital Humanities Contexts & Careers

Our emphasis, in Speaking in Code, on the professionalization of digital humanities developers is especially relevant because many of them have little to no formal training in computer science. Instead, they typically have deep training in particular disciplines of the humanities, and often encounter computer programming later in their academic careers as a way of furthering their own or others' research agendas. Their learning has therefore typically been self-directed. While it may be deep, this mode of learning can also result in understanding that is sporadic or inconsistent. The broader DH community will benefit from more explicit professional training opportunities in software development practices—particularly those designed to respect the special requirements and backgrounds of humanities developers. As issues of professionalization touch on alternative career paths, the growing body of thought and literature that is coalescing around the #alt-ac label is relevant to this discussion, as are broader critiques of the relation of the digital humanities to humanities scholarship: its aims, structures, and theoretical grounding.
