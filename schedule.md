# Schedule

The Speaking in Code from November 2013 was held over two days. The first day
began the discussion with a more formal group of talks, and the second day had
a number of un-conference-style break-out sessions.

## Day One

### Welcome

The welcome sets the tone of the summit, and it lays the ground rules. It
establishes an atmosphere of openness, candor, and respect.

The primary ground rule was that all discussions took place under the [Chatham
House Rule][chatham]---the information is open, but participants should not be
identified---especially as regard to Twitter, Facebook, and other social media.

This helps to create a safe arena for the discussion. Participants can speak
freely without fearing repercussions from colleagues, employers, or others who
may be unaware of the context and full meaning of their remarks.

### Presentation and discussion on a variety of topics

Most of the time on the first day was spent in a series of talks. Although
ostensibly more formal, some of these talks involved group activities and
brainstorming questions. All of them included time for questions and were
followed by lively discussions.

### Dinner

The first day was closed with a working dinner. Each table carried on
brainstorming- and discussion-sessions related to the activities and topics for
the next day.

## Day Two

The second day was meant to be more "hands-on" in the broadest sense. There
were a few more traditional hacking sessions; however, most of the sessions'
work involved discussion, pushing hard at their respective topics, and working
at understanding, if not always consensus.
