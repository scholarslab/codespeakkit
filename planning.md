# Participants

Probably the most important aspect of conducting a Speaking in Code event is
bringing together participants. You may choose to put on an event open to
anyone, and just see what develops. But because we had support for a limited
number of participants from the National Endowment for the Humanities, we put a
great deal of thought into what kind of discussions about DH software
development we wanted to provide a platform for, to encourage, and to amplify.

We took seriously the rare opportunity of our NEH grant to attract
deeply-experienced humanities computing developers, and so wanted to indicate
that we had not planned conversations suitable for programming novices. And yet
we were aware that the barriers to participation in technical conversations are
already too high. "You are Welcome Here," publicized as part of the Speaking in
Code call for participants, encapsulates our thoughts on this.

## "You are Welcome Here"

This statement was important for several reasons. First, it expressed the kind
of discussion that we wanted to take place. It set the tone for all of the
participants, both for developers from traditionally under-represented groups
(women, people of color, members of the queer/LGBT community, and others) and
for the cisgender white males who make up the largest percentage of software
developers inside and beyond DH, and whom we accurately predicted would be
likely to apply.

But most importantly, the statement went beyond a guarantee that we would make
our event a safe space. It was an invitation. We wanted to clarify that the
organizing team was actively seeking out voices that can be absent from other
software development settings—and to attract participants eager to listen and
to hear what their often-marginalized colleagues had to say.

This invitation is important enough that we'll reproduce it here:

> This is a small planning and problem-scoping meeting, meant to provide an
> opportunity for advanced software developers to address shared issues in DH
> and tacit knowledge&mdash;on their own terms. Participants are therefore
> expected to have contributed to digital humanities software projects at an
> intermediate or expert level, committing code or with responsibility for
> aspects of design, architecture, and technical project management that
> indicates past experience can be brought to bear. However, because software
> development—even in the more intellectually diverse and welcoming digital
> humanities—is a predominantly white and male profession, we are particularly
> committed to amplifying the voices of developers who are women, people of
> color, queer/LGBT, or otherwise under-represented among programmers, and to
> creating a friendly and respectful environment for collaboration at this
> event. Don't let [impostor
> syndrome](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) stop you from
> applying to Speaking in Code! If you have questions about your application,
> would like to nominate other participants, or have advice to share, please
> get in touch with us directly.

In that last sentence, we provided an email address for the entire organizing
group and a way to contact the event's primary organizer, a woman, privately.
Both options were used.

Applicants submitted simple information via a Google form. This included name,
title or role, contact info, current projects or institution, whether they were
requesting travel funding, and some brief prose on what they felt they would
bring to the discussion and what they might hope to learn. The form was
prefaced with this statement:

> Speaking in Code participants will be selected on the basis of their
> demonstrated experience in digital humanities software development, their
> interest in advancing solutions to the problems raised by the summit, and the
> disciplinary and cultural diversity they bring to the conversation. We
> particularly encourage and will prioritize applications by women developers,
> people of color, LGBT developers, and coders from other under-represented
> groups.

The statement led several participants to volunteer information that helped our
selection committee create a highly diverse group. After participants for the
event were selected, we edited the initial "You are Welcome Here" statement to
remove info directed at applicants and left the following:

> This is a small planning and problem-scoping meeting, meant to provide an
> opportunity for advanced software developers to address shared issues in DH
> and tacit knowledge—on their own terms. Because software development—even in
> the more intellectually diverse and welcoming digital humanities—is a
> predominantly white and male profession, we are particularly committed to
> amplifying the voices of developers who are women, people of color,
> queer/LGBT, or otherwise under-represented among programmers, and to creating
> a friendly and respectful environment for collaboration at this event.

You may use any of the text we have provided here verbatim, edit it to suit
your event or local community, or amplify it by developing and sharing a proper
anti-harassment policy or Code of Conduct. Resources on statements and codes
like these are available at [Geek
Feminism](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment) and
the [Ada
Initiative](https://adainitiative.org/2014/02/howto-design-a-code-of-conduct-for-your-community/).

# Involving speakers

Another important consideration is the group of speakers or facilitators to
invite. They can offer immediate provocations for conversations at the event.
In our model, they are not lecturers, but rather make brief presentations that
start a discussion, which participants then take over. They should be asked to
make some personal observations or plan an open-ended activity from which
conversations can move outward. We found it useful to bring facilitators
together for a Skype call to discuss overall goals and ethos of the meeting
beforehand. We were also careful to invite speakers with a strong track record
of teaching and working with diverse communities of developers and
student-developers, and who showed a strong commitment to inclusivity. For our
inaugural event at the Scholars' Lab, two of our six named speakers were women,
but none were people of color.

# What makes for a "productive" event?

Above all, a Speaking in Code discussion is meant to be productive. But
*productive* here isn't related to typical metrics of production like lines of
code or items on a burn-down chart.

Instead, to be *productive* is to create a sense of meaningful communication
and community-building. There may be action items that emerge from your
Speaking in Code summit, and we strongly encourage you to find ways to share
outcomes and results, but the fundamental product is the richer, more
thoughtful community that we co-create through discussions, informal working
sessions, and continued conversation in social media.
