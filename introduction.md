# Introduction

[Speaking in Code][codespeak] was an [NEH][neh]-funded symposium and summit.
For November 4â€“5, 2013, thirty-two software developers and practitioners active
in the digital humanities met at the [University of Virginia][uva]
[Library][uva-lib] [Scholars' Lab][slab]. They gathered with the intent of
exploring and making explicit some of the tacit knowledge that informs and
underlies software development, especially in the context of DH projects.

We spent our time in Speaking in Code *as practitioners*, reflecting on and
interrogating the context of our work, as well as the work itself, paying
special attention to welcoming and listening to marginalized voices.

And in the end, the focus of the meeting diverged, and the participants spent
the two days identifying and unpacking barriers, both barriers to access
digital humanities communities and barriers within those communities. This
might range from the knowledge required to perform the technical work to the
field's structures of review and promotion primarily addressing the needs of
academics. They also interrogated the working conditions, social and power
structures, and (lack of) diversity found in technical environments in general
and in DH work in particular.

The discussions were challenging, thought-provoking, and compelling, and we
want to share. We put together this kit to encourage those voices, to continue
those conversations, and to enable others to join in.

This kit is your key.

But there are no step-by-step instructions. In fact, your Speaking in Code will
look very different from the one held in November 2013. This presents a loose
set of suggestions, priorities, and practices to encourage the type of
discussion that we found so transformative. Still it will be *your* Speaking in
Code. It will grow out of your context and address the concerns of your
participants.

The main tool in this kit is a website template. It includes basic styling,
slots for necessary information, an application for interested practitioners,
and the *You are Welcome Here* statement. You can fork this git repository and
customize this template to begin the journey of hosting your own Speaking in
Code summit.

However, you don't have to do that much or wait that long to join in the
conversation. We are also continuing the discussion online:
