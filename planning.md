# Participants

Probably the most important aspect of conducting a Speaking in Code is the
participants. We put some thought into what kind of discussions and discourses
we wanted to provide a platform for, encourage, and amplify. We expressed the
result of that thought in our statement, "You are Welcome Here."

## You are Welcome Here

This statement expressed the kind of discussion that we wanted to take place.
This goes beyond having the assertion that this would be a safe space. More, we
wanted to make clear that we were actively looking for voices that are
marginalized in other software development settings. We wanted to listen and to
hear what they have to say. This also serves to set the tone for all of the
participants, including the white males.

This is so important that we'll reproduce it here:

> This is a small planning and problem-scoping meeting, meant to provide an
> opportunity for advanced software developers to address shared issues in DH
> and tacit knowledge—on their own terms. Because software development—even in
> the more intellectually diverse and welcoming digital humanities—is a
> predominantly white and male profession, we are particularly committed to
> amplifying the voices of developers who are women, people of color,
> queer/LGBT, or otherwise under-represented among programmers, and to creating
> a friendly and respectful environment for collaboration at this event.

# Speakers

The other important consideration is the speakers to invite. The speakers are
in some sense the leaders of the event, but in a very special sense.

The primary purpose of the speakers is to act as a provocation. Their
presentations start the discussion, but then the participants take over. The
topics begin, but don't dominate, and the discussion can move on from there.

# What is "productive"

In all of these, the discussion is meant to be productive. But *productive*
here isn't related to typical metrics of production, lines of code, or items on
a burn-down chart.

Instead, production here is a sense of meaningful discussion and community
being built. There may be an emphasis on action items coming out of the summit,
but the fundamental outcome is the community being created through the
discussions and informal sessions.
