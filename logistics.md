We won't attempt to cover all the event planning here. Just remember that
you're dealing with a technically sophisticated audience, so if they don't have
good wifi, they'll flop around like dying fish and squeal like insane banshees.
Lack of coffee will be just as bad, albeit less energetic.

Finally, and more seriously, the break-out sessions were where people connected
and where the most important conversations happened. Make sure there will be
enough space for several groups of varying sizes.
